## Current Documentation

For up-to-date documentation, see:

- **[docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](../ARCHITECTURE.md)** - Architecture overview
- **[docs/DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md](../DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md)** - Complete documentation index

## Why Archived?

These documents were useful during development but have been:
- Consolidated into main documentation
- Superseded by more recent analysis
- Made redundant by better organized documentation
- Completed and no longer actively maintained

These files are kept for historical reference but should not be updated.

## Statistics

- **Total archived files**: ~180 markdown files
- **Active documentation**: ~30 core files
- **Last organization**: 2025-01-03
