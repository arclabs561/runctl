# Archived Documentation

This directory contains older documentation that has been superseded or consolidated into the main docs.

## Files

- `FLOW_CRITIQUE.md` - Initial flow critique (consolidated into main docs)
- `IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md` - Implementation status (see main README)
- `SUMMARY.md` - Project summary (see main README)
- `FEATURES.md` - Features list (see main README and feature-specific docs)

## Why Archived?

These docs were useful during development but have been:
- Consolidated into main README.md
- Split into feature-specific docs (S3_OPERATIONS.md, RESOURCE_MANAGEMENT.md, etc.)
- Made redundant by better organized documentation

## Reference

These files are kept for historical reference but should not be updated. For current documentation, see the main [README.md](../../README.md) and docs in the root directory.
